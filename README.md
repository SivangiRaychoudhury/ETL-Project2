# ETL-Project2
First, we imported the crowdfunding excel file. Next we split the category and subcategory column into two separate columns. From there we created more standardized category and subcategory id names and matched them to their original category and subcategory id names. Then we saved those as csv tables. Next we made a campaign data by copying the original crowdfunding excel. Then we renamed the columns, changed a few data types, and merged the newly made dataframe with the category and subcategory dataframe. We dropped unwanted columns then exported it as a csv. For the contacts datafame, we completed Option 1 by splitting the first and last name, reordered the columns and then exported to csv file. As for the SQL portion, we created an ERD to demonstrate the connections we will make between the tables. We then created the schema (crowdfunding_db_schema) for table creation within Postgres. Then we imported the data from a CSV file for each table. Finally, we checked the data existed using a SELECT * FROM method.
